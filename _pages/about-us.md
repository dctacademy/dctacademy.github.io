## Design, Code & Test
Programming is an art as well as a science, it requires one to have a holistic knowledge of core programming concepts along with it’s allied technologies. For becoming a complete full stack developer one also needs to have a strong foundation on concepts like object-oriented programming and database design skills. We at DCT Academy believe that web development is a skill that anyone can acquire, by walking along a true and trusted path for learning. And yes of course! it requires a lot of dedication, hard work and commitment to the program.
